## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a Year 2 student pursuing a **Bachelor of Engineering in Computer and Autonomous Systems** at the **University of Wollongong in Dubai (UOWD)**.  
Passionate about robotics, embedded systems, and autonomous technologies, I am currently building my skills in **Linux, Python, ROS2, and Git/GitHub** through hands-on projects and structured learning.
